# Capstone-Project-3-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers' default credit card payments in Taiwan

Project Summary:
The objective of this project is to train various supervised learning algorithms to predict the client’s behavior in paying off the credit card balance. So  , I  first investigated the datasets by using exploratory data analysis techniques     *   Then I did some visualization of data and performed hypothesis testing choosing few hypothetical statements.Further I performed Feature Enginineering and Data Preprocessing which includes cleaning the data and performing categorical encoding.Next, through feature selection methods such as 'selection through VIF' , 'Quassi constant feature selection' , I could select the important features, dropping the rest.Also, then I found out the feature importance through Random forest embedded method.After this ,I performed Data scaling using 'Standard Scaler'. There were lot of imbalanced data.I used 'SMOTE' to handle it effectively . I performed Data Splitting where in I could split the data into Training data and Test Data.Finally , I applied various Classification algoritms such as 'Logistic Regression' , 'Random Forest Classification' and 'KNN classification algorithm' to predict the credit card defaulters.
